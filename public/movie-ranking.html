<h1>The Best Movies According to Andrei</h1>

<h2>Here are the Top 3 movies of all time, based on my opinion</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Fast & Furious Triolgy</h3>
<p>Really enjoiable set of movies. Action and racing are at their finest. 10/10 always.</p>

<h3>The Nun</h3>
<p>Both movies released had an impressive impact in the Horror world, mainly in the Conjuring universe. Great film, great attention to details.</p>

<h3>Miami Bici 2</h3>
<p>Very impressive on how the romanian film director managed to realise such a very good movie. Action, fun and overall details jump this movie to the very top.</p>
